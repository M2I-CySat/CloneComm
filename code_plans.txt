Checklist for future CloneComm development

* Add all command functionality!
    -This will be a fun one

* Add test mode, gray out "Send Command" button if serial/UART connection is not established
    -Test mode will be used to print information to the terminal in the absence of UART
* Print beacon messages to console

Implementing packets:
* Create single class for subsystem tab (all subsystem tabs are instances of the same class) 
    -Add a property "subsystem_id" to the class, the subsystem id for a tab will be used in sending commands from that tab
    -NOTE: Creating a single class for all subsystem tabs may be a bad idea if certain tabs need additional features
* Otherwise, use current tab layout, assign a subsystem id in each file that will be used in command sending
* OBC tab will be used for initial testing
