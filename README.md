# CloneComm
The new CySat-1 Ground Station for use with satellite-ground communications

CloneComm currently includes 5 subsystem tabs: OBC, ADCS, SDR, EPS, and UHF. Each tab contains a dropdown menu with commands for its corresponding subsystem. However, commands which cannot be sent to the satellite are not listed in the menu. When a command is selected from the dropdown menu, it can be sent using the "Send Command" button.

Some commands-- those which allow custom packet input-- will also activate a text input box. In order to send a command with custom packet input, the user must first provide text to the input box.
