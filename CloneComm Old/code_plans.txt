Checklist for future CloneComm development

* Add all command functionality!
    -This will be a fun one

* Add test mode, gray out "Send Command" button if serial/UART connection is not established
    -Test mode will be used to print information to the terminal in the absence of UART
* Print beacon messages to console

* Need to connect "Send Command" button with the UART; this is difficult because the UART connection code and tab code are in separate files
    -Also connect to log, although this is easier because log can always be accessed (unlike UART connection)
* Made separate files
* This might be one of the last key steps (other than debugging) necessary to complete CloneComm
